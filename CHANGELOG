- Wrote code in the `utils` directory to map evidence types to MI terms.  Converted both the interactomes and collapsed interactomes (flybase and uniprot versions) to this.  Most of the evidence types except for SignaLink, DroID studies, and ortholog mapping have MI terms.
- Retain DroID's 'unassigned4' edges -- replaced this with 'unpublished' where necessary.
- Replaced 'NA' with 'None' for some file processing
- Cleaned up parsing PubMedIDs and Evidence Types for DroID, Mentha, and myProteinNet
- Mentha edges now have no evidence type (it is originally the Mentha "score", which is not used)

- Added hashtags to header line of interactome files
- Implemented the "collapsed" version of the interactome, which maps IDs to common names
and merges based on similar names.  Insipired by Petra Wijngaard's senior thesis at Reed College.

- Added both aliases and genesymbol to mapping utilities (both are useful).
