- Combined the weighted file into the collapsed-interactome file so all information for the class is provided in a single file. 

2019-01-06 (in preparation for Derek's BIO372 Spring 2018)

- Weighted the interactome
- Determined optimal weight(s) using a parameter sweep
- Ran PageRank from sqh to generate candidates

2018-07-16 (in preparation for Carleton College's Computational Biology Workshop Fall 2018)

- Added hashtags to header line of interactome files
- Implemented the "collapsed" version of the interactome, which maps IDs to common names
and merges based on similar names.  Insipired by Petra Wijngaard's senior thesis at Reed College.

2017-11-05 (in preparation for BIO331 Fall 2017)
- Added both aliases and genesymbol to mapping utilities (both are useful).
